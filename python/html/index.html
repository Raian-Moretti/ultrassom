    <h1>Python</h1>
    <p>Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability,
        and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages
        such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and
        large scale. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and
        functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management
        and has a large and comprehensive standard library.
